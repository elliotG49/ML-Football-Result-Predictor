1. Take all predictions from the top 50, and split them into 5 bet builders, the first bet builder is the first 10 games, the second is the next 10 etc etc 
2. Once those have been created, the output should be the average betting score for those group of those games, aswell as the minimum bet score for those games. We also want to know the odds for those games 
(the odds for the team we have predicted) and then muliplty them togeter to give us the bet builder odds.
3. Now create 5 more bet builders (enhanced bet builders); we now want to take the top 15 highest odds games where the betting score is 80 or above.
4. Now take Bet Builder 1, and add in any 3 of those games (providing those games are not already in that bet). So  Bet Builder 1 Enhanced now has 13 games in it. After this we do this for all the bet builders to create 5 more enhnaced bet builders. For these we also want to see the new average, and mimum betting score and odds for each
5. Finnaly we want to create an ultimate bet builder, which is Bet Builder 1 and Bet Builder 2 combined. And that we also want to get the odds, average and minimum.

Each of these bet builders should also include the home_name and away_name, aswell as the prediction winner. I want each of these as a CSV please.

--note, if a match does not have any odds, please replace the 0 values with 1.
